"""raw_data_validation.py — SFF v2 · RUN · phase 0: the raw becomes computable.

"Load, review, condition, and establish a reference to compare against" (DISENO_V2 §5).
Not a single datum is modified: the raw is immutable — label, never amputate (P4). This
module is the OPERATIONAL part of phase 0, the minimum that must run every month before
any rate can be computed:

  0.1  validate_raw                 exhaustive contract + blocking checks; period normalized
       apply_current_month_doctrine the running month is the FIRST month to project;
                                    its early results are wiped
  0.2  build_fine_table             raw rows + fu_id / comb_id / fu_comb_key and their keys
       aggregate_to_forecast_units  one row per forecast unit, measures SUMMED, money
                                    conserved to the cent, fu_id unique
       build_key_lookups            id ↔ key tables so the keys work outside the framework
  0.3  label_universe_and_routes    universe · coverage pattern · route, as LABELS

The ANALYTICAL part of phase 0 — the immutable reference with the binomial worst-case
error per forecast unit — lives in `analysis/support_reference.py`: it reports, it does
not compute anything the forecast needs.

Every function here has one job, a contract docstring, and a test in
`tests/test_raw_data_validation.py`. Persisted column names stay in Spanish (`universo`,
`cobertura`, `ruta`): they are the contract of the tables and of the BI.
