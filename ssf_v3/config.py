"""config.py — SFF v3 · the configuration contract.

This module is the single place where the framework learns four things:

  1. TAXONOMY AND VALIDATION   which raw column plays which role (DISENO_V2 §3):
                               mandatory · timevarying (with sign) · extra_renovacion ·
                               extra_revalorizacion · measures · ignore. Every raw
                               column must be declared in exactly one role, or the
                               program stops (principle P3, the exhaustive contract).
  2. SERIES AND CELL COLUMNS   which columns define a rate series and an uplift cell.
                               DERIVED from the taxonomy, never typed:
                               rate_series_columns = mandatory + timevarying + extra_renovacion
                               uplift_cell_columns = mandatory + extra_revalorizacion
  3. KEYS AND IDS              how a row becomes an id ('|'-joined fields) and how an
                               id becomes a deterministic int64 key (P7).
  4. SQL PERSISTENCE           how a star-schema table is written back: physical name
                               registry with the `sff_` prefix, process_date and
                               execution_id stamped on every row, TRUNCATE/replace
                               semantics, fast_executemany on the pyodbc cursor.

  RAW SOURCE                   `read_raw()` returns the raw DataFrame and MUST be
                               overridden by the caller's main (production: its own
                               query; tests: the synthetic dataset). Nothing in `run/`
                               reads a file or a query.

Every tunable parameter lives in the TUNABLE PARAMETERS block of `Config`, grouped by
phase, each with its purpose, the reason for its default and what to look at before
changing it. PARAMETROS.md is the reader-facing version of that block.

Vocabulary: `extra_renovacion` / `extra_revalorizacion` are the doctrine names of the
two extra groups (the word "covariates" is forbidden). Persisted column names and
values stay in Spanish because they are the contract of the reference output and of the BI.

# THE CONFIG
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

@dataclass
class Config:
    """The single declaration of what the raw data IS and where the results GO.

    PURPOSE. Every phase of the framework needs to answer the same four questions, and
    none of them should answer any of them on its own: which column plays which role,
    which columns define a series and a cell in each branch, how a row becomes an id and a key, and under
    what name a result table is persisted. `Config` is the one place where those
    answers live, so that a change of taxonomy, of series definition or of destination is a change
    in ONE file and not a search across five phases.

    WHAT IT GUARANTEES.
      · Exhaustiveness (P3): a raw column with no declared role stops the run. There is
        no "unknown column" path, and therefore no column silently ignored.
      · Consistency of the taxonomy (DISENO_V2 §3): the exclusion rules are checked at
        construction, so a misdeclared Config never reaches a phase.
      · Derived definitions: the columns of a rate series and of an uplift cell are
        computed from the taxonomy by formula, never typed by hand; they cannot drift
        apart from it.
      · Reproducible identity: the same row yields the same id and the same key in any
        run, on any machine — the keys in SQL survive a re-execution.
      · Traceable persistence: every written row carries `process_date` and
        `execution_id`, and every table lands under the physical name of the registry.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not know where the raw comes from (`read_raw` is
    overridden by the caller's main), does not compute
    any forecast quantity, and does not decide anything measured: η², chosen technique
    and error bands are decisions of ANALYSIS, persisted in the decision tables
    (DISENO_SPLIT §3). Only the versioned business parameters live here
    (the TUNABLE PARAMETERS block below, grouped by phase):
    they are decisions of the repository, not measurements of a run.

    USAGE. Subclass it in your main and override `read_raw()`; `Config()` fields with
    no arguments are production. Tests pass a smaller taxonomy and inject a sqlite
    engine. Field names are the public contract used by every phase, by the runners and
    by the regeneration prompts; they do not change.
