"""support_reference.py — SFF v2 · ANALYSIS · phase 0.4: the immutable reference.

Before any rate is estimated, before any pool is formed, this table records for every
forecast unit how much support exists and what binomial error to expect in the worst
case. It is the yardstick everything later is compared against: a series whose band
after repair is not narrower than its own worst-case bound has gained nothing.

It is ANALYSIS, not RUN: no phase consumes it, no forecast number depends on it. It is
the artifact the analyst keeps to audit the monthly run without re-running anything.

Persisted as `forecast_units_raw_summary` (physical name `sff_fu_summary`).
