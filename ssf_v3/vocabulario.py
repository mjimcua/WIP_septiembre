"""vocabulario.py — SFF v3 · the ONE place where the persisted labels live.

Every value that reaches a table (a role, a sign, a treatment, a pipeline origin, a
risk level) is defined here, in Spanish, and imported by every module. The raw's own
contract values (`train`, `test`, `projection` in `dataset_role`) are mapped to this
vocabulary in phase 0 and never appear downstream.

Why one module: the same label was defined in six files, and a mixed vocabulary
(`trainable` next to `peldano`) crept into the tables. A label changed here changes
everywhere, tests included.
